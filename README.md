## Game Description

You are a GOOFLE Street View AI that is to supervise a human driver!
However, you are not allowed to take over control too much - otherwise the watchdog software will stop you!
You also need to make sure that you make a profit, so make sure to avoid fines by not hitting the skateboarding cats!
Finally, to finish the game you need to reach all the checkpoints on the street so that GOOFLE is happy with your performance.
